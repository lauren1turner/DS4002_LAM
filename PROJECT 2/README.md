## Repository Contents
This repository is for the Spring 2025 session of DS 4002 at The University of Virginia's School of Data Science. It contains the materials used to perform multivariate time series analysis on three years' worth of pollutant levels in Los Angeles, California. 

## Software and Platform
For this project, we used Google Colab and open source packages such as SKlearn. We got our data from the EPA, and downloaded each year's worth of data for one pollutant as one CSV file. This meant we had a total of 12 files. The additional packages installed and utilized were: matplotlib, numpy, statsmodels.tsa.stattools, statsmodels.tsa.vector_ar.var_model, pandas, and sklearn. The platform used was Windows.
